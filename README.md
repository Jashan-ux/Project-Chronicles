# Project-Chronicles
The blogs dedicated to sharing my coding projects and the lessons I learn along the way.

This Personal Blog Website is a dynamic platform designed using Flask (a Python web framework) for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. It enables users to explore and read various blog posts presented in a clean and responsive design. The project showcases how to create a functional blogging platform with a focus on simplicity and user engagement.

Key Features:
Dynamic Routing:

Blog posts are dynamically rendered using Flask routes based on unique IDs.
Each post has its own dedicated page for detailed content.
Custom Content:

Blog posts are stored locally or fetched via an API, making the platform flexible for different content sources.
The content can be personalized, allowing the user to display their own blogs or stories.
Responsive Design:

Built with Bootstrap to ensure the website looks great on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
Reusable Components:

Templates for the header, footer, and blog layout are modular, making the project scalable and easy to maintain.
Interactive UI:

The website uses modern CSS styling and JavaScript for interactivity and a seamless browsing experience.
Technologies Used:
Backend: Flask (Python)
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript
API Integration: Optionally supports fetching blog posts via an external API.
